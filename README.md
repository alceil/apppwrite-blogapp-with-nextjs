## üé¨ Getting Started!

### ü§ò Install Appwrite 
Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice. 
> Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend can access it.
1. Add a new Web App in Appwrite and enter the endpoint of your website (`localhost, <project-name>.vercel.app etc`)
2. Create a new collection with the following properties
* **Rules**
Add the following rules to the collection. 
> Make sure that your key exactly matches the key in the images
